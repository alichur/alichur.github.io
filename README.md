# Personal site
To share my contact details, blog and Resume.

# Goals
Usability first. For example supporting keyboard menu navigation comes before aesthetics.

#Tech stack
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It was a deliberate decision from the start to not add any extra technologies for the following reasons:

- I prefer to add third party libraries etc only once I've felt the pain for a long time.
- The site is unlikely to be more than 3 pages so I am comfortable with the level of repetition in the code (for example the menu code).
- The code might only be touched every few years so I want technology that doesn't require updating or learning new syntax.
- Potential page loading time gains. 
- Fun experiment.
