HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

It was a deliberate decision from the start to not add any extra technologies if possible for the following reasons:

- I prefer to add third party libraries etc only once I've felt the pain of not using them for a long time.
- The site is unlikely to ever be more than 3 pages so I am comfortable with the level of repetition in the code (for example repeating the menu code 3 times).
- The code might only be touched every few years so I want technology that doesn't require updating or learning new syntax.
- Potential page loading time gains. 
- Fun experiment.
