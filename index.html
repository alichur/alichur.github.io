                                  web application used by hospital clinicians to control patients' medications. I added new features to allow doctors
                                  to add notes to medications and monitor changes to a patient's medication history.
                                I wrote JavaScript unit tests for new and existing modules, fixed bugs, and refactored old code.

                                I was fortunate to interact with doctors who used Orion health software at the hospital. Seeing such a frantic
                                environment where software errors could affect a patient's health gave me a drive to always create well tested user friendly software.

                                  automated end to end tests to simulate frequent workflows such as a doctor ordering xRays and blood tests for a patient.
                                   I set up an office Testing Guild and was responsible for designing test plans,
                                  leading pre-release testing activities and advocating for best testing practices such as BDD.

                                  I have been the Scrum Master for my team, and seen different methods of scrum being implemented.
                                  Our team reflected frequently on our processes and we were constantly adding to our process for example
                                  crafting a new 'Definition of Done' for features, and 'Definition of Ready' for new feature requests and branching strategies for
                                  pain free development and CI.
                                  I was given the opportunity to attend these multiple day agile courses:
