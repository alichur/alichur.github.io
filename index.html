                              <p> As a full stack developer I worked on a <a href="https://orionhealth.com/global/products/medicines/ ">Medicines</a>
                                  web application for hospitals. I added features to allow doctors
                                  to add notes to medications and monitor changes to a patient's medication history.
                                I wrote JavaScript unit tests for new and existing modules, fixed bugs, and refactored old code. I provided weekly coaching sessions
                                for a graduate developer on another team, and helped train all new starts on my own team.

                                I was fortunate to interact with doctors who used Orion health software at the hospital. Seeing such a frantic
                                environment where software errors could affect a patient's health gave me a drive to always create intuative and reliable software.

                                  automated end to end tests to simulate frequent workflows such as a doctor ordering xRays and blood tests for a patient.
                                   I set up an office Testing Guild and was responsible for designing test plans,
                                  leading pre-release testing activities. I was the scrum master for my team for 6months of this period.

                                  After two years as a tester I set a goal to move into development. I gained a Java certification, attended architecture
                                  meetings and picked up larger and larger development tasks before formally changing my title to Software Developer.

                          <p> I was selected by the CEO of Orion Health for a position on the Junior Development Board. The board's
                              purpose was to work with senior leadership to bring fresh ideas for change to the company. For example to
                              improve staff retention we removed some heavy software release process and introduced volunteering
                              days to employees.

                              <p> I have practiced Agile Software Development in a variety of situations such as distributed teams,
                                and collaborating with an outsourcing company.
                                At Orion Health my team was constantly adding to our process for example
                                crafting a new 'Definition of Done' and refining branching strategies.
                                I was given the opportunity to attend these multiple day agile courses:

                                During my 4 years at Orion Health the office size grew from 20 to 100 and I took a leading role in
                                keeping our close friendly working culture alive and welcoming new members to the office. I founded the office social club
                                and organised several weekend events. I started a rugby and netball team and entered our office into a friendly local tournament.
